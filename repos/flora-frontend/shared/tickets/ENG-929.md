Thank you so much for looking at this right away! I may be blocked but maybe not, we can discuss how to either move forward or wait until we can confirm undo / redo

Thanks! Let me know if I can do anything to support you, including take other things off your plate

I'm taking this ticket and first we have to re-evaluate if it is still and issue and how big - what should redo that doesn't (or vice versa - this should still be nothing)?

waiting until after [https://github.com/florafauna-ai/flora-frontend/pull/2032](https://github.com/florafauna-ai/flora-frontend/pull/2032) is merged to diagnose
