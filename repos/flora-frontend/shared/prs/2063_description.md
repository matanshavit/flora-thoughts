# [ENG-976] Update PR 2025 with feedback from comments

## What problem does this PR solve?

This PR addresses critical security issues and code organization problems identified in the guest permissions implementation:

1. **Security Vulnerability**: Guest users could bypass restrictions and create projects through multiple entry points:
   - Through the onboarding flow when joining a workspace
   - Through direct navigation to `/new` route
   - Through API calls that weren't properly validated

2. **Code Duplication**: Role-based routing logic was duplicated across multiple dashboard components, making it error-prone and hard to maintain

3. **Scattered Permissions Logic**: Permission helper functions were spread across multiple files, causing inconsistency and duplication

4. **Legacy Code Confusion**: Multiple role definition systems existed in the codebase, creating confusion about which was authoritative

## What does this PR change?

### Security Fixes

- **Block Project Creation for Guests**: Implements comprehensive blocking at multiple levels:
  - Skip onboarding redirect for guest users in `/projects/page.tsx`
  - Redirect guests from `/new` route to `/projects/shared`
  - Add API-level protection in `saveProject` mutation to prevent project creation
  - Redirect guests to `/projects/shared` after accepting workspace invitations

### Code Organization Improvements

- **Centralized Routing Helper**: Created `getProjectUrl()` helper in `src/lib/routing/role-helpers.ts` that:
  - Determines correct project URL based on user role
  - Eliminates duplicate conditional logic across dashboard components
  - Ensures consistent routing behavior for guest vs regular users

- **Consolidated Permission Helpers**: Created `convex/permissions/helpers.ts` with:
  - `canInviteToWorkspace()`: Check if user can invite others
  - `canEditProject()`: Check if user can edit a project
  - `canManageFolder()`: Check if user can manage folders
  - Removed duplicate implementations from workspace helpers

- **Removed Legacy Code**: Deleted unused role definitions:
  - Removed `USER_ROLES` constant that wasn't referenced anywhere
  - Removed `UserRoleType` and `UserWithRole` interfaces
  - `UserRoleEnum` is now the single source of truth for roles

## How does this affect users?

### Guest Users
- Can no longer create projects through any vector (properly enforced)
- Are consistently redirected to read-only views (`/projects/shared`)
- Have a clearer, more predictable experience when joining workspaces

### Regular Users (Admins/Editors)
- No change in functionality
- Continued full access to create and edit projects

### Developers
- Cleaner, more maintainable codebase
- Single source of truth for role definitions
- Centralized permission logic reduces bugs

## Technical Details

### Files Changed
- **Security**: 4 files updated to block guest project creation
- **Routing**: 5 components updated to use centralized `getProjectUrl()` helper
- **Permissions**: New centralized helper file + 2 files updated to use it
- **Cleanup**: 2 files updated to remove legacy role definitions

### Testing
- [x] Unit tests pass (121 tests passing)
- [ ] Manual testing of guest user flows
- [ ] Manual testing of regular user flows
- [ ] Verified API-level protection works

## Migration Notes

No database migrations or breaking changes. The changes are backward compatible and improve existing functionality.

## Changelog

Fixed critical security issue where guest users could create projects through onboarding flow and improved permission system organization
