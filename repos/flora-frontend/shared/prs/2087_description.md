# Pull Request Description

## Summary

Simplifies the publish to community dialog by removing manual thumbnail selection and automatically using the first available project output as the preview image.

## What problem does this PR solve?

Users were experiencing confusion with empty thumbnail selectors in the publish dialog when trying to share their projects to the community. The manual selection process added unnecessary complexity to the publishing flow.

Linear ticket: [ENG-1049](https://linear.app/florafauna/issue/ENG-1049/publish-to-community-filter-by-empty-thumbnail)

## What does this PR do?

- Removes the manual thumbnail selector UI from the publish dialog
- Automatically selects the first available project output as the preview
- Removes upload functionality for custom preview images
- Simplifies state management and reduces component complexity

## Technical Approach

The approach simplifies the preview selection logic by removing user interaction and making it automatic. Instead of presenting users with a grid of thumbnails to choose from (which could include empty slots), the system now automatically uses the first available generated output.

### Key Changes:

- **publish-to-community-dialog.tsx**: Removed thumbnail selector UI, upload button, and associated state management
- **Preview Logic**: Simplified to automatically use the first available output from `projectOutputs`
- **Dependencies**: Removed unused imports (`uploadImageClient`, `cn`, `UploadIcon`, `ChangeEvent`, `useRef`)

### Performance Impact:

- Initial load time: Improved - Less UI components to render
- Runtime performance: Improved - Removed file upload handling and state updates
- Memory usage: Reduced - Eliminated upload state and ref management

## Screen Recording / Screenshots

### Before:

Users could manually select thumbnails and upload custom images, leading to empty thumbnail slots

### After:

N/A - UI simplification, preview is now automatically selected

## How to verify it

### Automated Verification:

- [x] Type checking passes: `pnpm typecheck`
- [ ] Build succeeds: `pnpm build` (requires database connection)
- [x] Unit tests pass: `pnpm test:unit`
- [x] Linting passes: `pnpm lint`

### Manual Verification Steps:

1. Open a project with generated outputs (images/videos)
2. Click on the share/publish to community button
3. Verify that the preview image automatically shows the first generated output
4. Publish the project and confirm it appears correctly in the community

### Expected Behavior:

- The publish dialog should display with the first project output automatically selected as preview
- No thumbnail selector grid should appear
- No upload button should be visible
- Publishing should work as before with the automatic preview selection
